# Dikes for dummies
This repository is a Python course that explores Object Oriented programming from a Product Development perspective.
We will be creating a very simple tool from scratch described in study case. The course will provide with tools, techniques and insides on how to apply Software Engineering concepts in the most effective way. Some code snippets will be provided so that the reader can find inspiration towards building a _Minimal Viable Product_.

Each chapter can be followed with its respective branch in the repository. Therefore it is not required to 'finish' each chapter to follow the next one.
